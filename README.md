# BST

In this project, I WAS tasked with implementing and extending functionality for a binary search tree (BST) in Java. The provided codebase included the BinarySearchTree class, and my goal was to complete the implementation of several methods within this class. The BST has an ordering property where any node's left subtree keys are less than or equal to the node's key, and the right subtree's keys are greater than or equal to the node's key.

Here are the key tasks I completed:

I implemented methods in the BinarySearchTree class that were marked with TODOs in the source code. This involved implementing methods like reorderIterator, postorderIterator, equals, and sameValues. I made sure not to change the signatures of public methods or add/remove such methods in the interface.

I paid attention to the provided comments in the BSTInterface class and ensured that my changes did not break the semantics of the methods.

I utilized recursive helper methods where appropriate, such as in the case of the equals method.

I considered updating the BSTNode class to maintain a reference to the node's parent, which involved adding getter and setter methods for this reference.

I understood and used utility methods provided in the codebase, like getRoot and toDotFormat.

I created additional tests beyond the provided minimal set to cover various cases for the implemented methods.

The assignment emphasized understanding binary trees, deciding between iterative and recursive methods, and implementing extensions to binary search trees based on textual descriptions. Debugging and thorough testing were also highlighted aspects of the project.
